<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-VEGF Agents</li><li>Corticosteroids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) treatment options mainly include Anti-VEGF agents and corticosteroids. Anti-VEGF agents are designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, reducing abnormal blood vessel growth and helping improve vision. Corticosteroids, on the other hand, work by reducing inflammation and edema in the retina, often used in advanced cases. Both types play a crucial role in managing PDR, improving patient outcomes by stabilizing or enhancing visual function while targeting the underlying pathophysiological processes of the disease.</p></p>
